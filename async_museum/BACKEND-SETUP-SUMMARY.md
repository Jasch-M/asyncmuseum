# Backend Setup Summary

## What Has Been Accomplished

We have successfully set up a Ktor backend with PostgreSQL database integration for the Museum frontend application. Here's a summary of what has been implemented:

### Backend Structure
- Created a Kotlin/Ktor project structure with Gradle build system
- Implemented necessary Ktor plugins for:
  - JSON serialization
  - CORS support
  - JWT authentication
  - Database connectivity
- Set up PostgreSQL database integration using Exposed ORM

### Data Models and Database
- Defined database tables for:
  - Exhibits
  - Events
  - Visitor Information
  - Users (for authentication)
  - Contact Submissions
- Created corresponding Kotlin data models with serialization support

### API Endpoints
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for:
  - Exhibits (CRUD operations)
  - Events (CRUD operations)
  - Visitor Information (get and update)
  - Authentication (login, logout)
  - Contact Form submissions

### Frontend Integration
- Updated the frontend API service to use axios for real HTTP requests
- Added proper error handling and response parsing
- Implemented JWT token storage and management

### Development Tools
- Added Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL
- Created comprehensive documentation in README.md
- Added environment variable configuration with .env.example
- Set up proper .gitignore for the backend

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Set up the PostgreSQL database**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./gradlew run
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Populate the database** with initial data:
   - The backend will automatically create the database tables
   - You may want to create a script to populate the database with initial exhibits, events, and visitor information

6. **Enhance authentication**:
   - Implement proper token validation with Google and Facebook
   - Add protected routes that require authentication

7. **Add admin functionality**:
   - Create admin-only endpoints for managing content
   - Implement role-based access control

8. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for backend services
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Test the frontend-backend integration thoroughly

9. **Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy the backend to a cloud provider
   - Configure production database

## Conclusion

The backend is now set up and ready for development. The structure follows best practices for Ktor applications and provides a solid foundation for further development. The frontend has been updated to communicate with the backend API, and all the necessary components are in place for a full-stack application.
